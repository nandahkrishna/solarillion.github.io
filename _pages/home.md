Solarillion Foundation is a not-for-profit research, outreach and education organization working with research institutions, government agencies and organizations to carry out research on policy, technology and related areas in the field of Machine Learning, Internet of Things, Embedded Systems, Renewable Energy, and Sustainable Engineering.

Established in 2012, Solarillion encourages and mentors highly motivated under-graduate and graduate students and young professionals interested in research in the emerging areas of ML, IoT and Microgrids. These students will ideally continue to pursue higher education in established institutions and follow a career path in engineering research and innovation.
